# DS4A

A repository for Data Science for All (DS4A) work. As I start my journey as a DS4A fellow at Correlation One, I wanted to collect and post my work. I hope to see how my programming skills progress over the course of the fellowship.

### Project 1 RSA Encryption and Decryption:
This is a mini-project which involves a simplified version of the [RSA Algorithm](https://brilliant.org/wiki/rsa-encryption/). The goal was to encrypt a user-inputed message and then decyrpt a list of integers back into the original message.
